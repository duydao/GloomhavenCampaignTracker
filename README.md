# GloomhavenCampaignTracker

I created this app to track campaign progression for the Gloomhaven.

Gloomhaven is a boardgame with tactical roundbased fights wrapped in a campaign with a story and a changing world depending on your decisions. The changes in the world and the progression of the player characters are tracked with papersheets and stickers.

I wanted to keep the components free of stickers and the papersheets clean. Also I wanted to be able to play multiple campaigns. That's why I needed a way to track the progression of the campaigns seperate from each other. That's not easy with the components of the game. I decided to create an android app. My first android app so far. I'm a professional software developer but I was new to mobile development.

In may 2017 I started to learn android and create the Gloomhaven Campaign Tracker app. I had no physical copy of the game but a lot of informations you can find online. Isaak shares a lot of the games content with the community.

I released the first version in September 2017 and continued bugfixing and adding content since today.

Here you can find the app in the play store:
