# Gloomhaven Campaign Tracker for Android

I have created this app to track the progression of multiple campaigns and multiple parties in the boardgame Gloomhaven.

Gloomhaven is a boardgame with tactical roundbased fights wrapped in a campaign with a story and a changing world depending on your decisions. The changes in the world and the progression of the player characters are tracked with papersheets and stickers.

I backed the second edition Kickstarter campaign in April 2017. After that I had to wait until November to recieve my copy and I started to plan how to play this game.
I wanted to keep the components free of stickers and the papersheets clean. Also I wanted to be able to play multiple campaigns. That's why I needed a way to track the progression of the campaigns seperate from each other. That's not easy with the components of the game. I decided to create an android app. My first android app so far. I'm a professional software developer but I was new to mobile development.

In may 2017 I started to learn how to develop an android app with Xamarin and created the Gloomhaven Campaign Tracker app. I had no physical copy of the game but a lot of informations you can find online. Isaak shares a lot of the games content with the community.

I released the first version of my app in September 2017 and continued bugfixing and adding content since today.

It is important to me to keep the app free of spoilers. And I don't want to spoil anything for myself. So the locked content of the game will be added as I'm playing through the campaign. 

My graphical skills are not very high, that's why the app doesn't have some fancy graphical effects. I focus on the functionality and will try to add some more eye candy when I find the time for it.  

Here you can find the app in the play store:
